# Code of Conduct

We want Machina to be a calm, pragmatic place to build weird automation safely.

## The basics
- Be respectful and kind.
- Assume good intent; ask before you accuse.
- Prefer clear, reproducible reports (logs, replay files, steps).
- No harassment, hate speech, or doxxing.

## In reviews
- Critique code, not people.
- Suggest alternatives, not just problems.
- Keep security in mind: don’t propose weakening allowlists/limits without an explicit threat model.

## Reporting issues
If something here is violated, open an issue labeled **conduct** or contact the maintainers privately.
